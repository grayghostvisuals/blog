# YOUR GRIDS, HOWEVER YOU WANT THEM
Gridset gives you your grids in a multitude of different formats to fit into your workflow however you want. From PNGs and PDFs for working in Photoshop or similar, to an overlay and CSS for prototyping and working in the browser.  

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Your Gridset assets
In this grid package are:
1. PNGs of all your grids
2. A grid overlay Javascript file
3. Raw CSS for rapid prototyping (uncompressed)
4. CSS for production (compressed)
5. A demo HTML file to see how Gridset output can be applied

### PNGs for Raster Output
Do you use Photoshop or Fireworks for your design work? No problem. For every grid in your grid set we provide a PNG for you to drop into your graphics editor of choice. 

### Grid Overlay script
For helping you design to your grid in the browser, we've included a useful little script that toggles on and off your grids. Just include it at the bottom of your HTML file and append your URL with "?gridset=show" to turn it on. The overlay will work on all grids within your set providing accurate guides to work to.

### CSS for Rapid Prototyping and Production
The default CSS for Gridset is compressed (gzipped) so is not editable in a text editor. To edit the CSS directly, use the .raw.css file.

### DEMO.HTML
This is a simple HTML file showing how your Gridset CSS can be applied to HTML elements.
